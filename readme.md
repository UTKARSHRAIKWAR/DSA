## 🚀 Phase 1: Core DSA Concepts (4–6 weeks)

### 📦 Arrays & Strings

- Array basics, prefix sum
- Sliding window technique
- Two pointers, Kadane’s Algorithm
- StringBuilder, pattern matching

**Practice:** 25–30 problems  
**LeetCode Tags:** Arrays, Strings, Two Pointers

### 🔗 Linked List

- Singly/Doubly Linked List
- Reverse LL, Detect loop (Floyd's Algo)
- Merge two sorted LL, K-th node, Palindrome LL

**Practice:** 15–20 problems

### 📚 Stack & Queue

- Infix/Prefix/Postfix conversions
- Min stack, Next Greater Element
- Queue using stack, Circular Queue
- Deque, LRU Cache (LinkedHashMap or Deque)

**Practice:** 20 problems

---

## 🌳 Phase 2: Trees and Recursion (3–4 weeks)

### 🌿 Binary Trees & BST

- Inorder, Preorder, Postorder
- Level order, Height, Diameter
- Balanced BST, Invert Binary Tree
- Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

### 🧠 Recursion & Backtracking

- Subsets, Permutations
- N-Queens, Rat in Maze
- Sudoku Solver

**Practice:** 30–40 problems total

---

## 📈 Phase 3: Advanced DSA Topics (5–6 weeks)

### 🗺️ Searching & Sorting

- Binary search on answers (search space)
- QuickSort, MergeSort, CountSort
- Kth smallest/largest, Sorting comparator

### 🧮 Hashing & Heaps

- HashMap, HashSet, Frequency map
- PriorityQueue (min/max heaps)
- Top K Frequent, Sort by Frequency

### 🔢 Bit Manipulation

- XOR problems, Bit masking
- Power of 2, Set/Unset bits

### 📊 Sliding Window & Two Pointers

- Max sum subarray of size K
- Longest substring without repeating chars
- Container with most water

### 📐 Dynamic Programming (DP)

- 0/1 Knapsack, Subset sum
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- DP on grids (m\*n)
- Tabulation vs Memoization

---

## 🌐 Phase 4: Graphs (2–3 weeks)

- BFS, DFS (Matrix + Adjacency List)
- Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algo, DFS)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm (PriorityQueue)
- Union Find (Disjoint Set), Kruskal’s Algo
- Cycle detection (Directed/Undirected)

---

## 🎯 Phase 5: Final Prep + Mock (Ongoing)

### 📌 Practice Patterns:

- LeetCode 75
- Blind 75
- Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet
- Love Babbar 450

### 📌 Weekly Schedule (Sample):

| Day | Focus                            |
| --- | -------------------------------- |
| Mon | Learn new concept + 3-5 problems |
| Tue | Practice more problems           |
| Wed | Revise + solve old problems      |
| Thu | Learn another topic              |
| Fri | Contest or mock interview        |
| Sat | Resume & Notes revision          |
| Sun | Rest or catch-up day             |
